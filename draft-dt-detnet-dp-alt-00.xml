 <section title="Introduction">
  <t>
    Deterministic Networking (DetNet) <xref
    target="I-D.finn-detnet-problem-statement"/> provides a capability to carry
    unicast or multicast data streams for real-time applications with extremely
    low data loss rates and known upper bound maximum latency <xref
    target="I-D.finn-detnet-architecture"/>. The deterministic networking
    Quality of Service (QoS) is expressed as 1) the maximum end-to-end latency
    from sender (talker) to receiver (listener), and 2) probability of loss of a
    packet.  Only the worst-case values for the mentioned parameters are
    concerned.
  </t>
  <t>
    There are three techniques to achieve the QoS required by deterministic
    networks:
     <list style="symbols">
      <t>zero congestion loss,</t>
      <t>explicit routes,</t>
      <t>packet replications and deletion.</t>
     </list>
   This document identifies existing IP and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   <xref target="RFC3031"/>, layer-2 or layer-3 encapsulations and transport
   protocols  that could be considered as foundations for a
   deterministic networking data plane.  The full scope of the deterministic
   networking data plane solution is considered including, as appropriate,
   quality of service (QoS), operations and management (O&amp;M), and time
   synchronization among other criteria decribed in <xref target="sec_crit"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
   This document does not select a deterministic networking data
   plane protocol.  It does, however, elaborate what it would
   require to adapt and use a specific protocol as the
   deterministic networking data plane solution.  This document is
   only concerned with data plane considerations and,
   specifically, with topics that potentially impact potential
   deterministic networking aware data plane hardware.  
   Control plane considerations are out of scope of this document.

   prepare reader to realize the potential impact on the DetNet aware harware].

 <t>
   A "Deterministic Network" will be composed of DetNet enabled
   "end systems" and DetNet enabled "network nodes".  DetNet
   enabled network nodes will provide a DetNet service to attached
   DetNet end systems.  All DetNet enabled systems and nodes will
   be interconnected by sub-networks.  These sub-networks will
   provide DetNet compatible service for support of DetNet
   traffic.  Examples of sub-networks include 802.1TSN and a
   point-to-point OTN link.  Of course, multi-layer DetNet systems
   may be possible too, where one DetNet appears as a sub-network,
   and provides service to, a higher layer DetNet system. A
   simple DetNet is shown in <xref target="fig_detnet"/>.

  This DetNet data plane is logically divided into two layers:
   <list style="symbols">
    <t>The Det layer provides adaptation of DetNet services.  It
    is composed of a shim layer to carry DetNet flow specific
    attributes, which are needed during forwarding. End systems
    originate and terminate the Det layer and are peers at the Det
    layer.</t>
    <t>The Net layer is supported by all DetNet aware systems and
    nodes.  It operates below the Det layer. The Net layer is used
    to relay traffic end to end across a DetNet domain.</t>
   </list>
  Distinguishing the function of these two DetNet data plane
  layers helps to explore and evaluate various combinations of the
  data plane solutions available.  This separation of DetNet
  layers, while helpful, should not be considered as formal
  requirements.  For example, some technologies may violate these
  strict layers and still be able to deliver a DetNet service.
 </t>
 
 <t>
  [Lou's note: I think we're being overly 'cute' in the layer
  naming here.  I think DetNet 'Service' or 'Client' layer for the
  'Det' layer, and DetNet 'Transport' or 'Server' layer for the
  'Net' layer would be better in the long term.]
 </t>

 <t>
  A number of data plane technology candidates are discussed later in this
  document. They can be mapped to the two layers as shown in
  <xref target="fig_adaptation"/>.

 <t>
  Both the Det and the Net layers are provided by a single technology in some
  solutions, e.g. the Det layer is PW and the Net layer is MPLS in case of PW
  over MPLS. Nonetheless, both the Det and the Net layers can include multiple 
  technology layers in other solutions in order to provide the capabilities
  needed for DetNet flows. For instance, the Net layer can comprise MPLS-in-GRE 
  (<xref target="sec_alt_pwe"/>) in one solution. In another solution, the Det
  layer can include, e.g.,  RTP in UDP (<xref target="sec_alt_higher"/>).
 </t>
  
 <t>
  [Lou's note: I', not sure if the remainder of this section says
  anything not present in the next section. Will need to revisit
  as part of the pre-pub review.]
 </t>

 <t>
  There are many valid options to create a data plane solution for DetNet
  traffic by selecting a technology approach for the Det layer and also 
  selecting a technology approach for the Net layer. There are a high number of
  valid combinations. Therefore, not the combinations but the different
  technologies are evaluated along the criteria collected in 
  <xref target="sec_crit"/>. Different criteria apply for the Det layer and the
  Net layer, however, some of the criteria are valid for both layers.
 </t> 


 <t>
  The criteria for the Det layer:
   <list style="nosymbols">
    <t>#1 Encapsulation and overhead</t>
    <t>#2 Stream identification (Flow ID part of the DetNet stream)</t>
    <t>#3 Packet sequencing (sequence number)</t>
    <t>#5 Packet replication and deletion (note: only the packet deletion for
       seamless redundancy)</t>
    <t>#6 Operations and management (capabilities)</t>
    <t>#7 Time synchronization (e.g., time stamping)</t>
    <t>#8 Class and quality of service capabilities (Det specific)</t>
    <t>#10 Technical maturity</t>
   </list>  
 </t> 
 
 <t>
  The criteria for the Net layer:
   <list style="nosymbols">
    <t>#1 Encapsulation and overhead</t>
    <t>#2 Stream identification (Egress ID)</t>
    <t>#4 Explicit routes (network path)</t>
    <t>#5 Packet replication and deletion (note: only the packet replication
       for seamless redundancy)</t>
    <t>#6 Operations and management (capabilities)</t>
    <t>#7 Time synchronization (time/phase sync of nodes)</t>
    <t>#8 Class and quality of service capabilities (Net specific)</t>
    <t>#9 Packet traceability (verification purposes)</t>
    <t>#10 Technical maturity</t>
   </list> 
   <list style="nosymbols">
    <t>
     [Editor's note: #7 is more of OAM feature.]
    </t>
   </list> 
 </t> 
 
 <t>
  Some of the criteria are relevant for both the Det and Net layers. The two 
  layers provide together what is needed to meet certain criteria, e.g., stream
  identification. Different aspects are valid for the two different layers for
  other criteria, e.g., time synchronization. Furthermore, technical maturity is
  a criteria valid for both layers.
 </t> 
 
 <t>
  The Stream ID is compound of a Flow ID and an Egress ID in order to provide a 
  unique ID for a DetNet flow. The Egress ID belongs to the Net layer as it is
  required for routing the flow. On top of that, the Flow ID provides the
  identification in the Det layer. Taking PW over MPLS as an example, the LSP
  label of the egress node is the Egress ID, and the PW label is the Flow ID on
  top.
 </t>  
 
 <t>
  Class and quality of service capabilities are typically provided by the
  technologies available at the Net layer, as well as the ones available at the
  Det layer. However, both the Det and Net layers have their own specific
  aspects. For instance, the TC field of the PW label belongs to the Det layer
  whereas the TC field of the LSP labels belongs to the Net layer. Mapping
  between the QoS parameters of the two different layers is possible depending
  on the network scenario.
 </t>  

 <t>
  Different aspects of time synchronization are provided by the two different 
  layers. The Det layer provides timing information for the applications using
  DetNet flows, e.g., via time stamps. The Net layer provides time and/or phase
  synchronization among network nodes, e.g., using IEEE 1588 or one of its
  Profiles.
 </t>
</section>

<section title="Criteria for data plane solution alternatives" anchor="sec_crit">
 <t>
   This section provides criteria to help evaluate potential
   options.  The criteria can be broken down based on layer.  That
   is if the criteria is focused on delivering DetNet service
   adaptation, i.e., is concerned with the Det layer, or if the
   criteria is focused on transporting flows across an end to end
   DetNet domain. [LB: this is TBD.]
 </t>
  
  <t>
   Each deterministic networking data plane solution alternative is described
   and evaluated using the criteria described in this section. The used criteria
   enumerated in this section are selected so that they highlight the existence
   or lack of features that are expected or seen important to a solution
   alternative for the data plane solution. 
  </t>
 

  <section title="#? DetNet Service Interface" anchor="sec_crit_svc">
    <t>
      One of the most fundamental differentiators between
      different potential data plane options is the basic
      addressing and headers used by DetNet clients.  For example,
      is the basic service a Layer 2 (e.g., Ethernet) or Layer 3
      (i.e., IP) service. This decision impacts how DetNet end
      points are addressed, and the basic forwarding logic of the
      Det layer.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="#1 Encapsulation and overhead" anchor="sec_crit_encap">
    <t>
      Encapsulation and overhead is related to how the Det layer carries DetNet
      user traffic.  In several cases a deterministic flow/strem has to be
      encapsulated inside other protocols, for example, when transporting a
      layer-2 Ethernet frame over an IP transport network. In some cases a
      former tunneling like encapsulation can be avoided by underlying
      transport protocol translation, for example, translating layer-2 Ethernet
      frame including addressing and stream identification into native IP
      traffic. Last it is possible that talkers and listeners handle
      deterministic flows natively in layer-3.  This criteria concerns what is
      the encapsulation method the solution alternative support: tunneling like
      encapsulation, protocol translation or native layer-3 transport. In
      addition to the encapsulation mechanism this criteria is also concerned
      of the processing and specifically the encapsulate header overhead.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="#2 Stream identification" anchor="sec_crit_streamid">
    <t>
      [LB: can we do a global replace of stream with flow?  Stream has a few
      IP-specific meanings and I'd like to avoid at least one -- if you're
      really interested look into IPv5.]
    </t>
    <t>
     The solution alternative has to provide means to identify specific
     deterministic flows / streams. The stream identification can, for example,
     be explicit field in the data plane encapsulation header or implicitly
     encoded into the addressing scheme of the used data plane protocol. This
     criteria concerns the availability and details of deterministic flow /
     stream  identification the data plane protocol alternative has.
    </t>
  </section>

    </t>
    <t>
     The solution alternative has to provide means for end systems to number
     packets sequentially and transport that sequencing information along with
     the sent packets. In addition to possible reordering packets one of the
     important uses for sequencing is detecting duplicates. In a case of
     intentional packet duplication a combination of stream identification and
     packet sequencing allows for detecting and discarding duplicates at the
     receiver (see <xref target="sec_crit_repdup"/> for more details).  This criteria
     concerns the availability and details of the packet sequencing
     capabilities the data plane protocol alternative has.

  <section title="#4 Explicit routes" anchor="sec_crit_explicit">
    <t>
     The solution alternative has to provide a mechanism(s) for establishing
     explicit routes that all packets belonging to a deterministic flow /
     stream will follow. The explicit route can be seen as a form of source
     routing or a pre-reserved path e.g., using some network management
     procedure. It should be noted that the explicit route does not need to be
     detailed to a level where every possible intermediate node along the path
     is part of the named explicit route. The IEEE 802.1Qca <xref
     target="IEEE8021Qca"/> specification defines how to do explicit path
     control in a bridged network and its IETF counter part is defined in 
     <xref target="I-D.ietf-isis-pcr"/>. This criteria concerns the
     available mechanisms for explicit routes for the data plane protocol
     alternative.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="#5 Packet replication and deletion" anchor="sec_crit_repdup">
    <t>
     The solution alternative has to provide means for end systems and/or relay
     systems to be able to replicate packets, and later eliminate all but one of
     the replicas, at multiple points in the network in order to ensure that one
     (or more) equipment failure events still leave at least one path intact for
     a deterministic networking stream. The goal is to enable hitless 1+1
     protection in a way that no packet gets lost or there is no ramp up time
     when either one of the paths fails for one reason or another.
    </t>
    <t>
     The IEEE 802.1CB <xref target="IEEE8021CB"/> is an example of
     Ethernet-based solution that defines packet sequence numbering, packet
     replication, and duplicate packet identification and deletion. The
     deterministic networking data plane solution alternative at layer-3 has to
     provide equivalent functionality. This criteria concerns the available
     mechanisms for packet replication and duplicate deletion the data plane
     protocol alternative has.

  <section title="#6 Operations and management" anchor="sec_crit_oam" >
    <t>
     The solution alternative should demonstrate an availability of appropriate
     standardized O&amp;M tools or control/management plane that can be
     extended for deterministic networking purposes with a reasonable effort,
     when required. The O&amp;M tools do not necessarily need to be specific to
     the data plane protocol as it could be the case, for example, with
     MPLS-based data planes.

  </section>

  <section title="#7 Time synchronization" anchor="sec_crit_sync">
    <t>
      Time synchronization between DetNet systems and nodes can be used to
      enable fine grain scheduling of traffic along an end-to-end data path.
      Such scheduling can be used to deliver very low jitter and latency.
      [DetNet-ARCH] refers to a synchronization target of less than 1 microsecond.  
    </t>

  <section title="#8 Class and quality of service capabilities" anchor="sec_crit_qos">
    <t>
     The data plane solution alternative should provide means for class of
     service (CoS) based traffic classification, for example, for queuing
     discipline.  Existing CoS traffic classification enablers include but are
     not limited to IP header differentiated services code point (DSCP) field
     <xref target="RFC2474"/>, MPLS label traffic class field <xref
     target="RFC5462"/>, and IEEE 803.1p priority code point (PCP) field to name
     few.
    </t>
    <t>
     Quality of Service (QoS) is a mechanism for flow/stream specific traffic
     treatment and typically includes a guarantee/agreement for the service.
     In the context of the data plane solution alternative there should be
     means for flow/stream identification, which then can be used to map a
     flow/stream against specific resources and treatment in a node enforcing
     the QoS.  Example QoS mechanisms include discrete resource allocation,
     admission control, flow identification and isolation, and sometimes path
     control, traffic protection, shaping, policing and remarking.

     This Criteria concerns the availability and mechanisms for the CoS and QoS
     marking and signaling as a part of the data plane protocol solution alternative.

     This criteria concerns the availability of solutions for
     tracing packets in the context of data plane protocol alternative.

  <section title="#10 Technical maturity" anchor="sec_crit_matu">
    <t>
     The technical maturity of the data plane solution alternative is crucial,

     the use of the solution in deployments. For example, the maturity level
     can be categorised as available immediately, available with small
     extensions, available with repurposing/redefining portions of the protocol
     or its header fields.  Yet another important measure for maturity is the
     deployment experience. This criteria concerns the maturity of the data

     This section investigates the application of native IPv6 <xref
     target="RFC2460"/> as the data plane for deterministic networking along the
     criteria collected in <xref target="sec_crit"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
     The application of higher OSI layer headers, i.e., headers deeper in the
     packet, can be considered. Two aspects have to be taken into account for
     such solutions. (i) Those header fields can be encrypted. (ii) Those
     header fields are deeper in the packet, therefore, routers have to apply
     deep packet inspection. See further details in
     <xref target="sec_alt_higher"/>.

    <t><list style="hanging">
     <t hangText="Encapsulation and overhead (W)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Deterministic flows are assumed to be handled natively at layer-3 by IPv6
      at the first place. The fixed header of an IPv6 packet is 40 bytes <xref
      target="RFC2460"/>. This overhead is bigger if any Extension Header is
      used, and a generic behaviour for host and forwarding nodes is specified
      in <xref target="RFC7045"/>.
      However, the exact overhead (<xref target="sec_crit_encap"/>)
      depends on what solution is actually used to provide DetNet features,
      e.g., explicit routing or seamless redundancy if any of these is applied.     
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      IPv6 has two types of Extension Headers that are processed by intermediate
      routers between the source and the final destination and may be of interest
      for the data plane signaling, the Routing Header that is used to direct the
      traffic via intermediate routers in a strict or loose source routing way,
      and the Hop-by-Hop Options Header that carries optional information that
      must be examined by every node along a packet's delivery path. The 
      Hop-by-Hop Options Header, when present, must immediately follow the IPv6
      Header and it is not possible to limit its processing to the end points of
      Source Routed segments. 
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      IPv6 also provides a Destination Options Header that is used to carry
      optional information to be examined only by a packet's destination node(s).
      The encoding of the options used in the Hop-by-Hop and in the Destination
      Options Header indicates the expected behavior when a processing IPv6 node
      does not recognize the Option Type, e.g. skip or drop; it should be noted
      that due to performance restrictions nodes may ignore the Hop-by-Hop Option
      Header, drop packets containing a Hop-by-Hop Option Header, or assign
      packets containing a Hop-by-Hop Option Header to a slow processing path
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis"/> (e.g. punt packets from hardware
      to software forwarding which is highly detrimental to the performance).
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The creation of new Extension Headers that would need to be processed by
      intermediate nodes is strongly discouraged. In particular, new Extension
      Header(s) having hop-by-hop behavior must not be created or specified.
      New options for the existing Hop-by-Hop Header should not be created or
      specified unless no alternative solution is feasible
       <xref target="RFC6564"/>.
   
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      </t>
    
     <t hangText="Stream identification (M/W)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The 20-bit flow label field of the fixed IPv6 header is suitable to
      distinguish different deterministic flows/streams. But guidance on the use
      of the flow label provided by <xref target="RFC6437"/> places restrictions
      on how the flow label can be used. In particular, labels should be chosen
      from an approximation to a discrete uniform distribution. Additionally,
      existing implementations generally do not open APIs to control the flow
      label from the upper layers.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Alternatively, the Stream identification could
      be transported in a new option in the Hop-by-Hop Options Header. 
     <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
     
     <!-- t hangText="Packet sequencing (W/N)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Packet sequencing would require a new option in an IPv6 Extension Header.
      One approach could  be to encapsulate the packets in IP-in-IP tunnels that
      would terminate at the elimination points. In that case, the sequence
      number is only useful to the destination of the outer IPv6 header, and it
      could be placed in a new option in the Destination Options Header in the
      encapsulation.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Alternatively, the sequence number could also be transported in another new
      option in the Hop-by-Hop Options Header. 
     <vspace blankLines="1"/></t -->
     
     <t hangText="Explicit routes (W)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The general assumption is that a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
      <xref target="RFC7426"/> based approach is applied to compute, establish
      and manage the explicit routes, leveraging Traffic Engineering (TE)
      extensions to routing protocols <xref target="RFC5305"/>
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution"/> and evolutions to the
      Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture <xref target="RFC5440"/>, 
      though a number of issues remain to be solved <xref target="RFC7399"/>.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Segment Routing (SR) <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/> is a
      new initiative to equip IPv6 with explicit routing capabilities.
      The idea for the DetNet data plane would be to apply SR to IPv6 with the
      addition of a new type of routing extension header <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header"/> to explicitly signal the
      path in the data plane between the source and the destination, and/or
      between replication points and elimination points if this functionality
      is used. 
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Another concern regarding packet replication is how to enforce 
      replicated packets to take different route while the final destination 
      still remains the same.
      With strict source routing, all the intermediate hops are listed and paths
      can be guaranteed to be non-overlapping. Loose source routing only signals
      some of the intermediate hops and it takes additional knowledge to ensure
      that there is no single point of failure.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>    
     </t>
     
     <t hangText="Packet replication (W)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      [Editor's note: at the Net layer this criteria does not concern packet
      deletion, only the packet replication. The packet deletion belongs to 
      the Det layer] 
      <!-- vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The implementation of this functionality largely depends on the
      packet sequencing and flow/stream identification approaches. The above
      discussion on the potential use of new Options for packet sequencing and
      flow/stream identification approaches, as well as source routing and IP
      tunnels to signal explicit paths, also applies here. -->
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The functionality of replicating a packet exists in IPv6 but is limited
      to multicast flows. On the other hand, there is currently no specification
      for the duplicate packet deletion functionality at the elimination points.
      The behaviour of keeping a state about received packets exists in Neighbor
      Discovery during the address resolution process, but it is limited to final
      delivery and prone to DOS attacks.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      As discussed above, IP-in-IP encapsulation and Segment Routing could be 
      leveraged to signal a segment in a packet. 
      A replication point would insert a different routing header in each copy it
      makes, the routing header providing explicitly the hops to the elimination
      point for that particular replica of the packet, in a strict or in a loose
      source routing fashion.
      An elimination point would pop the routing headers from the various copies
      it gets and forward or receive the packet if it is the final destination.

     <t hangText="Operations and management (M/W)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      IPv6 enjoys the existing toolbox for generic IP network management.
      However, IPv6 specific management features are still not at the level of
      that IPv4 has. This specifically concerns the areas that are IPv6 specific,
      for example, related to neighbor discovery protocol (ND), stateless address
      autoconfiguration (SLAAC), subscriber identification, and security.
      While the standards are already mostly in place the implementations in
      deployed equipment can be lacking or inadequate for commercial
      deployments. This is largely only an issue with old existing equipment.
    <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
    
     <!-- t hangText="Time synchronization (W/N)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      IPv6 has no existing supporting mechanisms for anything time
      synchronization. A new extension header would be needed for this purpose,
      if such functionality is required.

     <t hangText="Class and quality of service capabilities (M)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>

     <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
    
     <t hangText="Packet traceability (M/W/N)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The traceability of replicated packets involves the capability to resolve
      which replication point issued a particular copy of a packet, which segment
      was intended for that replica, and which particular packet of which
      particular stream this is. sequence also depends on the sequencing
      mechanism. The replication point may be indicated as the source of the
      packet if IP-in-IP encapsulation is used to forward along segments.
      An alternate to IP-in-IP tunneling along segments would be to protect the
      original source address in a destination option similar to the Home Address
      option <xref target="RFC6275"/> and then use the address of the replication
      point as source in the IP header.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The traceability also involves the capability to determine if a particular
      segment is operational. While IPv6 as such has no support for reversing a
      path this, it appears source route extensions such as the one defined for
      segment routing could be used for tracing purposes. Though it is not a 
      usual practice, IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"/> expects that a Source Route
      path may be reversed, and the standard insists that a node must not include
      the reverse of a Routing Header in the response unless the received Routing
      Header was authenticated.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
    
     <t hangText="Technical maturity (M/W)">

      IPv6 has been around about 20 years. However, large scale global and
      commercial IPv6 deployments are rather new dating only few years back to

      to work on as they show up once operations experience grows.

     IPv4 <xref target="RFC0791"/> is in principle the same as IPv6, except that
     it has a smaller address space. However, IPv6 was designed around the fact
     that extension headers are an integral part of the protocol and operation
     from the beginning, although the practise may some times prove differently
     <xref target="I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world"/>. IPv4 never really
     needed any extension headers to work properly, thus support for IPv4 options
     outside closed networks cannot typically be guaranteed. In the context of
     deterministic networking data plane solutions the major difference between
     IPv4 and IPv6 seems to be the practical support for header extensibility.
     Anything below and above the IP header independent of the verion is
     practically the same.

      been proposed to be used for actually identifying flows/streams between two

     This section concentrates on MPLS <xref target="RFC3031"/><xref
     target="RFC3032"/> i.e., to a data plane solutions where a payload traffic
     is transported directly over MPLS. Basically, MPLS is capable of
     transporting any traffic payload, not just IP. However, in non-IP transport
     payload cases the solution quickly starts to resemble PseudoWires (see <xref
     target="sec_alt_pwe"/>) or other MPLS-based solutions with appropriate
     shim/adaptation layer between the MPLS label and the transported payload
     (see Sections <xref format="counter" target="sec_alt_bier"/> and <xref
     format="counter" target="sec_alt_bier_te"/>).
    </t>
    <t>
     In the contex of deterministic networking the MPLS as such is specifically
     on the "Net" layer. Some additional functionality or a shim layer on a top
     of the MPLS trasnport is most likely needed on the "Det" layer to enable a
     complete deterministic networking data plane solution.

     PWs appear as a good data plane solution alternative for a number of
     reasons. PWs are a proven and deployed technology with a rich O&amp;M
     control plane <xref target="RFC4447"/>, and enjoy the toolbox developed for
     MPLS networks. Furthermore, PWs may have an optional Control Word (CW) as
     part of the payload encapsulation between the PSN and the emulated service
     that is, for example, capable of frame sequencing and duplicate detection.
     The encapsulation layer may also provide timing  <xref target="RFC5087"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
     PWs can be also used if the PSN is IP, which enables the application of PWs
     in networks that do not have MPLS enabled in their core routers. One
     approach to provide PWs over IP is to provide MPLS over IP in some way and 
     then leverage what is available for PWs over MPLS. The following standard
     solutions are available both for IPv4 and IPv6 to follow this approach. The
     different solutions have different overhead as discussed in the following 
     subsection. The MPLS-in-IP encapsulation is specified by
     <xref target="RFC4023"/>. The IPv4 Protocol Number field or the IPv6 Next 
     Header field is set to 137, which indicates an MPLS unicast packet. (The use
     of the MPLS-in-IP encapsulation for MPLS multicast packets is not supported.)
     The MPLS-in-GRE encapsulation is specified in <xref target="RFC4023"/>, 
     where the IP header (either IPv4 or IPv6) is followed by a GRE header, which
     is followed by an MPLS label stack. The protocol type field in the GRE
     header is set to MPLS Unicast (0x8847) or Multicast (0x8848). MPLS over
     L2TPv3 over IP encapsulation is specified by <xref target="RFC4817"/>. The
     MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation is specified by <xref target="RFC7510"/>, where 
     the UDP Destination Port indicates tunneled MPLS packet and the UDP Source 
     Port is an entropy value that is generated by the encapsulator to uniquely
     identify a flow. MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation can be applied to enable
     UDP-based ECMP (Equal-Cost Multipath) or Link Aggregation. All these
     solutions can be secured with IPSec.
    </t>

     <t hangText="Encapsulation and overhead (M)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      PWs offer encapsulation services practically for any types of payloads
      over any PSN.  New PW types need a code point allocation <xref
      target="RFC4446"/> and in some cases an emulated service specific
      document.
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      Specifically in the case of the MPLS PSN the PW encapsulation overhead is
      minimal. Typically minimum two labels and a CW is needed, which totals to
      12 octets. PW type specific handling might, however, allow optimizations
      on the emulated service in the provider edge (PE) device's native service
      processing (NSP) / forwarder function. These optimizations could be used,
      for example, to reduce header overhead. Ethernet PWs already have rather
      low overhead <xref target="RFC4448"/>. Without a CW and VLAN tags the
      Ethernet header gets reduced to 14 octets (minimum Ethernet header
      overhead is 26).
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      The overhead is somewhat bigger in case of IP PSN if an MPLS over IP 
      solution is applied to provide PWs. IP adds at least 20 (IPv4) or 40 (IPv6)
      bytes overhead to the PW over MPLS overhead; furthermore, the GRE, L2TPv3,
      or UDP header has to be taken into account if any of these further 
      encapsulations is used.
     <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
     
     <t hangText="Stream identification (M)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      PWs provide multiple layers of stream identification, especially in the case
      of the MPLS PSN. The PWs are typically prepended with a PW label that can be
      used to identify a specific PW. Furthermore, the PSN also uses one or more
      labels to transport packets over a specific label switched paths (that then
      would carry PWs). IP (and other) PSNs would need other mechanisms, such as, 
      UDP port numbers, upper layer protocol header (like TRP) or some IP extension
      header to provide required stream identification.
     <vspace blankLines="1"/></t>
     
     <t hangText="Packet sequencing (M)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      As mentioned earlier PWs may contain an optional CW that is able to provide
      sequencing services. The size of the sequence number in the generic CW is
      16 bits, which might be, depending on the used link speed be too little.

     <!--t hangText="Explicit routes (M)">

      target="RFC5921"/> <xref target="RFC2702"/><xref target="RFC3209"/>.
      Furthermore, the PSN may also use segment routing (SR) to provide explicit
      routes <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing"/>. Segmement routing
      based solution would also be available for IPv6 PSN <xref

      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      It is possible to carry time synchronization information as part of the PW
      encapsulation layer (see for example <xref target="RFC5087"/>). Whether
      the timing precision is enough for all deterministic networking use cases
      vary, and it is possible existing mechanisms are not adequate for all use
      cases. IP PSNs have already demonstarted the use of time synchronization 
      as a part of PWE3  <xref target="RFC5086"/>.

     <t hangText="Class and quality of service capabilities (M)">
      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
      In a case of IP PSN the 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP)
      field can be used for indicating the class of service <xref
      target="RFC2474"/> and 2-bit field reserved for the explicit congestion
      notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168"/>. Similarly, in a case of MPLS
      PSN, there are 3-bit traffic class field (TC) <xref target="RFC5462"/> in
      the label reserved for for both  Explicitly TC-encoded-PSC LSPs (E-LSP)
      <xref target="RFC3270"/> and ECN <xref target="RFC5129"/>.  Due to the
      limited number of bits in the TC field, their use for QoS and ECN
      functions restricted and intended to be flexible. Although the Qos/CoS
      mechanism is already in place some clarifications may be required in the
      context of deterministic networking flows/streams, for example, if some
      specific mapping between bit fields have to be done.

      In a case of MPLS PSN and an approach where PWs are prepended with a PSN
      layer outer label (or more labels in a stack) help tracing the explicit
      reverse path of the packet using the outer label(s) as the key. Even if the
      PW labels of the duplicated packets were the same the outer labels should
      be different. However, even this approach is not "perfect" since the
      intermediate node identities are not recorded into the packet hop-by-hop
      basis as some protocol do (for example, Diameter protocol loop detection

   The DetNet may be presented in BIER as distinctive payload type with its own 
   Proto(col) ID. Then it is likely that DetNet will have the header that would 
   identify:

   DetNet node, collocated with BFIR, may use multiple BIER sub-domains to
   create replicated flows. Downstream DetNet nodes, collocated with BFER, would
   terminate redundant flows based on Sequence Number and/or Timestamp
   information. Such DetNet may be BFER in one BIER sub-domain and BFIR in
   another. Thus DetNet flow would traverse several BIER sub-domains.

  <t>
   An alternate use of Bit-Indexed Explicit Replication (BIER) uses bits in the
   BitString to represent adjacencies as opposed to destinations, as discussed in
   <xref target="I-D.eckert-bier-te-arch"> BIER Traffic Engineering (TE)</xref>.
   </t><t>
   The proposed function of BIER-TE in the DetNet data plane is to control the
   process of replication and elimination, as opposed to the identification of
   the flows or and the sequencing of packets within a flow.
   </t><t>
   At the path ingress, BIER-TE identifies the adjacencies that are activated
   for this packet (under the rule of the controller). At the egress, BIER-TE is 
   used to identify the adjacencies where transmission failed. This information
   is passed to the controller, which in turn can modify the active adjacencies
   for the next packets.
   </t><t>
   The value is that the replication can be controlled and monitored with the
   granularity of a packet and a adjacency in a control loops that involves an
   external controller.
  </t>
  <!--section title="On BIER-TE">
  <t>
   BIER-TE supports traffic engineering by explicit hop-by-hop forwarding
   and loose hop forwarding of packets. 
     </t><t>
      From the BIER-TE architecture, the key differences over BIER are:
      <list style="symbols">
      <t>BIER-TE replaces in-network autonomous path calculation by
         explicit paths calculated offpath by the BIER-TE controller host.
      </t>
      <t>In BIER-TE every BitPosition of the BitString of a BIER-TE packet
         indicates one or more adjacencies - instead of a BFER as in BIER.
      </t>
      <t>BIER-TE in each BFR has no routing table but only a BIER-TE
         Forwarding Table (BIFT) indexed by SI:BitPosition and populated
         with only those adjacencies to which the BFR should replicate
         packets to.
      </t>
      </list>        
   The generic view of an adjacency can be over a link, a tunnel or along a
   path segment. 
  </t><t>
   With <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing">Segment Routing</xref> a
   segment can be signaled as an MPLS label, or an IPv6 routing header .  A
   segment may be loosely of strictly source routed, depending on the need for
   full non-congruence and the confidence that loose routing may still achieve
   that need.

   BIER-TE enables to activate the replication and elimination functions in a
   manner that is abstract to the data plane forwarding information.  An
   adjacency, which is represented by a bit in the BIER header, can correspond
   in the data plane to an Ethernet hop, a Label Switched Path, or it can
   correspond to an IPv6 loose or strict source routed path. 
     </t><t>
   In a nutshell, BIER-TE is used as follows:
     <list style="symbols">
     <t>
     A controller computes a complex path, sometimes called a track, which takes
     the general form of a ladder. The steps and the side rails between them
     are the adjacencies that can be activated on demand on a per-packet basis
     using bits in the BIER header.

     The controller assigns a BIER domain, and inside that domain, assigns bits
     to the adjacencies. The controller assigns each bit to a replication node
     that sends towards the adjacency, for instance the ingress router into a
     segment that will insert a routing header in the packet. A single bit may
     be used for a step in the ladder, indicating the other end of the step in

     The controller activates the replication by deciding the setting of the

     place. Below is an example that uses Replication and Elimination to protect

 <t>
   For the DetNet data plane, a replication point is an ingress point for more
   than one adjacency, and an elimination point is an egress point for more than
   one adjacency.
   </t><t>   
   A pre-populated state in a replication node indicates which bits are
   served by this node and to which adjacency each of these bits corresponds.
   With DetNet, the state is typically installed by a controller entity such as
   a PCE. 
   The way the adjacency is signaled in the packet is fully abstracted in the
   bit representation and must be provisioned to the replication nodes and 
   maintained as a local state, together with the timing or shaping information
   for the associated flow.
  </t><t>
   The DetNet data plane uses BIER-TE to control which adjacencies are used
   for a given packet. This is signaled from the path ingress, which sets the
   appropriate bits in the BIER BitString to indicate which replications must
   happen.
  </t><t>
   The replication point clears the bit associated to the adjacency where the
   replica is placed, and the elimination points perform a logical AND of the
   BitStrings of the copies that it gets before forwarding.   
  </t><t>     
   As is apparent in the examples above, clearing the bits enables to trace a
   packet to the replication points that made any particular copy. BIER-TE also
   enables to detect the failing adjacencies or sequences of adjacencies along a
   path and to activate additional replications to counter balance the failures.
    </t><t>
   Finally, using the same BIER-TE bit for both directions of the steps of the
   ladder enables to avoid replication in both directions along the crossing
   adjacencies. At the time of sending along the step of the ladder, the bit may
   have been already reset by performing the AND operation with the copy from
   the other side, in which case the transmission is not needed and does not
   occur (since the control bit is now off).

   <section title="Higher layer header fields" anchor="sec_alt_higher">
    <t>
      Fields of headers belonging to higher OSI layers, e.g., transport  layer,
      can be used to implement functionality that is not provided e.g., by the
      IPv6 or IPv4 header fields. However, this approach cannot be always
      applied, e.g., due to encryption. Furthermore, even if this approach is
      applicable, it requires deep packet inspection from the routers and
      switches. There are implementation dependent limits how far into the
      packet the lookup can be done efficiently in the fast path. In general a
      safe bet is between 128 and 256 octets for the maximum lookup depth.
      Various higher layer protocols can be applied. Some examples are provided
      here for the sequence numbering feature (<xref target="sec_crit_seq"/>).

    <section title="TCP">
    <t>
      The TCP header includes a sequence number parameter, which can be applied
      to detect and eliminate duplicate packets if seamless redundancy is used.
      As the TCP header is right after the IP header, it does not require very 
      deep packet inspection; the 4-byte sequence number is conveyed by bits 32
      through 63 of the TCP header.  In addition to sequencing, the TCP header
      also contain source and destination port information that can be used for
      assisting the flow/stream identification.
    </t>
    </section> 
    
    <section title="RTP">
    <t>
      RTP is often used to deliver time critical traffic in IP networks. RTP is
      is carried on top of IP and UDP <xref target="RFC3550"/>. The RTP header
      includes a 2-byte sequence number, which can be used to detect and
      eliminate duplicate packets if seamless redundancy is used. The sequence
      number is conveyed by bits 16 through 31 of the RTP header. In addition to
      the sequence number the RTP header has also timestamp field (bits 32
      through 63) that can be useful for time synchronization purposes.
      Furthermore, the RTP header has also one or more synchronization sources
      (bits starting from 64) that can potentially be useful for flow/stream
      identification purposes.
