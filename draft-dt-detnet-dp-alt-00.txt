1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) [I-D.finn-detnet-problem-statement]
   provides a capability to carry unicast or multicast data flows for
   real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and known
   upper bound maximum latency [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture].  The
   deterministic networking Quality of Service (QoS) is expressed as 1)
   the maximum end-to-end latency from sender (talker) to receiver
   (listener), and 2) probability of loss of a packet.  Only the worst-
   case values for the mentioned parameters are concerned.

   There are three techniques to achieve the QoS required by
   deterministic networks:

   o  zero congestion loss,
   o  explicit routes,
   o  packet replication and deletion.

   This document identifies existing IP and Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031], layer-2 or layer-3 encapsulations and
   transport protocols that could be considered as foundations for a
   deterministic networking data plane.  The full scope of the
   deterministic networking data plane solution is considered including,
   as appropriate: quality of service (QoS); Operations, Administration
   and Maintenance (OAM); and time synchronization among other criteria
   decribed in Section 3.

   This document does not select a deterministic networking data plane
   protocol.  It does, however, elaborate what it would require to adapt
   and use a specific protocol as the deterministic networking data
   plane solution.  This document is only concerned with data plane
   considerations and, specifically, with topics that potentially impact
   potential deterministic networking aware data plane hardware.
   Control plane considerations are out of scope of this document.

2.  DetNet Data Plane Overview

   [Editor's note: all/portions of the following may be moved to the
   DetNet Architecture document at some future point.]

   A "Deterministic Network" will be composed of DetNet enabled "end
   systems" and DetNet enabled "network nodes".  DetNet enabled network
   nodes will provide a DetNet service to attached DetNet end systems.
   All DetNet enabled systems and nodes will be interconnected by sub-
   networks.  These sub-networks will provide DetNet compatible service
   for support of DetNet traffic.  Examples of sub-networks include
   802.1TSN and a point-to-point OTN link.  Of course, multi-layer
   DetNet systems may be possible too, where one DetNet appears as a
   sub-network, and provides service to, a higher layer DetNet system.
   A simple DetNet is shown in Figure 1.

   This DetNet data plane is logically divided into two layers:

   o  The DetNet Service layer provides adaptation of DetNet services.
      It is composed of a shim layer to carry DetNet flow specific
      attributes, which are needed during forwarding.  End systems
      originate and terminate the Det layer and are peers at the DetNet
      Service layer.
   o  The DetNet Transport layer is supported by all DetNet aware
      systems and nodes.  It operates below the DetNet Service layer.
      The Detnet Transport layer is used to relay traffic end to end
      across a DetNet domain.

   Distinguishing the function of these two DetNet data plane layers
   helps to explore and evaluate various combinations of the data plane
   solutions available.  This separation of DetNet layers, while
   helpful, should not be considered as formal requirements.  For
   example, some technologies may violate these strict layers and still
   be able to deliver a DetNet service.

   A number of data plane technology candidates are discussed later in
   this document.  They can be mapped to the two layers as shown in
   Figure 2.

                 Figure 2: DetNet adaptation to data plane

   Both the DetiNet Service and the DetNet Transport layers are provided
   by a single technology in some solutions, e.g. the DetNet Service
   layer is PW and the DetNet Transport layer is MPLS in case of PW over
   MPLS.  Nonetheless, both the DetNet Service and the DetNet Transport
   layers can include multiple technology layers in other solutions in
   order to provide the capabilities needed for DetNet flows.  For
   instance, the DetNet Transport layer can comprise MPLS-in-GRE
   (Section 5.4) in one solution.  In another solution, the DetNet
   Service layer can include, e.g., RTP in UDP (Section 5.6).

   [Lou's note: I', not sure if the remainder of this section says
   anything not present in the next section.  Will need to revisit as
   part of the pre-pub review.]

   There are many valid options to create a data plane solution for
   DetNet traffic by selecting a technology approach for the DetNet
   Service layer and also selecting a technology approach for the DetNet
   Transport layer.  There are a high number of valid combinations.
   Therefore, not the combinations but the different technologies are
   evaluated along the criteria collected in Section 3.  Different
   criteria apply for the DetNet Service layer and the DetNet Transport
   layer, however, some of the criteria are valid for both layers.

   The criteria for the DetNet Service layer:

      #1 Encapsulation and overhead
      #2 Stream identification (Flow ID part of the DetNet flows)
      #3 Packet sequencing (sequence number)
      #5 Packet replication and deletion (note: only the packet deletion
      for seamless redundancy)
      #6 Operations, Administration and Maintenance (capabilities)
      #7 Time synchronization (e.g., time stamping)
      #8 Class and quality of service capabilities (DetNet Service
      specific)
      #10 Technical maturity

   The criteria for the DetNet Transport layer:

      #1 Encapsulation and overhead
      #2 Stream identification (Egress ID)
      #4 Explicit routes (network path)
      #5 Packet replication and deletion (note: only the packet
      replication for seamless redundancy)
      #6 Operations, Administration and Maintenance (capabilities)
      #7 Time synchronization (time/phase sync of nodes)
      #8 Class and quality of service capabilities (DetNet Transport
      specific)
      #9 Packet traceability (verification purposes)
      #10 Technical maturity

      [Editor's note: #7 is more of OAM feature.]

   Some of the criteria are relevant for both the DetNet Service and
   DetNet Transport layers.  The two layers provide together what is
   needed to meet certain criteria, e.g., flow identification.
   Different aspects are valid for the two different layers for other
   criteria, e.g., time synchronization.  Furthermore, technical
   maturity is a criteria valid for both layers.

   The Stream ID is compound of a Flow ID and an Egress ID in order to
   provide a unique ID for a DetNet flow.  The Egress ID belongs to the
   DetNet Transport layer as it is required for routing the flow.  On
   top of that, the Flow ID provides the identification in the DetNet
   Service layer.  Taking PW over MPLS as an example, the LSP label of
   the egress node is the Egress ID, and the PW label is the Flow ID on
   top.

   Class and quality of service capabilities are typically provided by
   the technologies available at the DetNet Transport layer, as well as
   the ones available at the DetNet Service layer.  However, both the
   DetNet Service and DetNet Transport layers have their own specific
   aspects.  For instance, the TC field of the PW label belongs to the
   DetNet Service layer whereas the TC field of the LSP labels belongs

   to the DetNet Transport layer.  Mapping between the QoS parameters of
   the two different layers is possible depending on the network
   scenario.

   Different aspects of time synchronization are provided by the two
   different layers.  The DetNet Service layer provides timing
   information for the applications using DetNet flows, e.g., via time
   stamps.  The DetNet Transport layer provides time and/or phase
   synchronization among network nodes, e.g., using IEEE 1588 or one of
   its Profiles.

3.  Criteria for data plane solution alternatives

   This section provides criteria to help evaluate potential options.
   The criteria can be broken down based on layer.  That is if the
   criteria is focused on delivering DetNet service adaptation, i.e., is
   concerned with the DetNet Service layer, or if the criteria is
   focused on transporting flows across an end to end DetNet domain.
   [Lou B.: this is TBD.]

   Each deterministic networking data plane solution alternative is
   described and evaluated using the criteria described in this section.
   The used criteria enumerated in this section are selected so that
   they highlight the existence or lack of features that are expected or
   seen important to a solution alternative for the data plane solution.

3.1.  #? DetNet Service Interface

   One of the most fundamental differentiators between different
   potential data plane options is the basic addressing and headers used
   by DetNet clients.  For example, is the basic service a Layer 2
   (e.g., Ethernet) or Layer 3 (i.e., IP) service.  This decision
   impacts how DetNet end points are addressed, and the basic forwarding
   logic of the DetNet Service layer.

3.2.  #1 Encapsulation and overhead

   Encapsulation and overhead is related to how the DetNet Service layer
   carries DetNet user traffic.  In several cases a deterministic flow
   has to be encapsulated inside other protocols, for example, when
   transporting a layer-2 Ethernet frame over an IP transport network.
   In some cases a former tunneling like encapsulation can be avoided by
   underlying transport protocol translation, for example, translating
   layer-2 Ethernet frame including addressing and flow identification
   into native IP traffic.  Last it is possible that talkers and
   listeners handle deterministic flows natively in layer-3.  This
   criteria concerns what is the encapsulation method the solution
   alternative support: tunneling like encapsulation, protocol

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


   translation or native layer-3 transport.  In addition to the
   encapsulation mechanism this criteria is also concerned of the
   processing and specifically the encapsulate header overhead.

3.3.  #2 Stream identification

   The solution alternative has to provide means to identify specific
   deterministic flows.  The flow identification can, for example, be
   explicit field in the data plane encapsulation header or implicitly
   encoded into the addressing scheme of the used data plane protocol.
   This criteria concerns the availability and details of deterministic
   flow identification the data plane protocol alternative has.

3.4.  #3 Packet sequencing

   [LB is in order delivery a strict requirement?  if so, it should be
   stated as such and separately from any other requirement.  There are
   multiple ways to solve this criteria.]

   The solution alternative has to provide means for end systems to
   number packets sequentially and transport that sequencing information
   along with the sent packets.  In addition to possible reordering
   packets one of the important uses for sequencing is detecting
   duplicates.  In a case of intentional packet duplication a
   combination of flow identification and packet sequencing allows for
   detecting and discarding duplicates at the receiver (see Section 3.6
   for more details).  This criteria concerns the availability and
   details of the packet sequencing capabilities the data plane protocol
   alternative has.

3.5.  #4 Explicit routes

   The solution alternative has to provide a mechanism(s) for
   establishing explicit routes that all packets belonging to a
   deterministic flow will follow.  The explicit route can be seen as a
   form of source routing or a pre-reserved path e.g., using some
   network management procedure.  It should be noted that the explicit
   route does not need to be detailed to a level where every possible
   intermediate node along the path is part of the named explicit route.
   RSVP-TE [RFC3209] supports explicit routes, and typically provides
   pinned data paths for established LSPs.  At Layer-2, the IEEE
   802.1Qca [IEEE8021Qca] specification defines how to do explicit path
   control in a bridged network and its IETF counter part is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-pcr].  This criteria concerns the available mechanisms
   for explicit routes for the data plane protocol alternative.

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


3.6.  #5 Packet replication and deletion

   The objective for supporting packet replication and deletio is to
   enable hitless (or lossless) 1+1 protection, which is also called
   Seemless redundancy in [I-D.finn-detnet-architecture].  Data plane
   solutions need to meet this objective independent of the particular
   solution used.  In other words, a packet replication and deletion is
   one identified method for a data plane solution to provide seemless
   redundancy and other methods, if so identified, are permissible.

   The solution alternative has to provide means for end systems and/or
   relay systems to be able to replicate packets, and later eliminate
   all but one of the replicas, at multiple points in the network in
   order to ensure that one (or more) equipment failure events still
   leave at least one path intact for a deterministic networking flow.
   The goal is to enable hitless 1+1 protection in a way that no packet
   gets lost or there is no ramp up time when either one of the paths
   fails for one reason or another.

   The IEEE 802.1CB [IEEE8021CB] is an example of Ethernet-based
   solution that defines packet sequence numbering, packet replication,
   and duplicate packet identification and deletion.  The deterministic
   networking data plane solution alternative at layer-3 has to provide
   equivalent functionality.  This criteria concerns the available
   mechanisms for packet replication and duplicate deletion the data
   plane protocol alternative has.

3.7.  #6 Operations, Administration and Maintenance

   The solution alternative should demonstrate an availability of
   appropriate standardized OAM tools that can be extended for
   deterministic networking purposes with a reasonable effort, when
   required.  The OAM tools do not necessarily need to be specific to
   the data plane protocol as it could be the case, for example, with
   MPLS-based data planes.  But any OAM-related implications or
   requirements on data plane hardware must be considered.

3.8.  #7 Time synchronization

   Time synchronization between DetNet systems and nodes can be used to
   enable fine grain scheduling of traffic along an end-to-end data
   path.  Such scheduling can be used to deliver very low jitter and
   latency.  [DetNet-ARCH] refers to a synchronization target of less
   than 1 microsecond.  Meeting such time synchronization objectives is
   likely to require specific hardware support, both at the
   synchronization protocol level and at the (time synchronized) packet
   scheduling level.  It is worth noting that certain aspects of time
   synchronization and packet scheduling may be provided by the

   underlying sub-net technology, e.g., [IEEE802.1Qbv] and
   [IEEE802.1Qch].

3.9.  #8 Class and quality of service capabilities

   Class and quality of service, i.e., CoS and QoS, are terms that are
   often used interchangeably and confused.  In the context of DetNet,
   CoS is used to refer to mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding
   treatment based on aggregate group basis and QoS is used to refer to
   mechanisms that provide traffic forwarding treatment based on a
   specific DetNet flow basis.  Examples of CoS mechanisms include
   DiffServ which is enabled by IP header differentiated services code
   point (DSCP) field [RFC2474] and MPLS label traffic class field
   [RFC5462], and at Layer-2, by IEEE 803.1p priority code point (PCP).

   Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms for flow specific traffic
   treatment and typically includes a guarantee/agreement for the
   service, and allocation of resources to support the service.  Example
   QoS mechanisms include discrete resource allocation, admission
   control, flow identification and isolation, and sometimes path
   control, traffic protection, shaping, policing and remarking.
   Example protocols that support QoS control include Resource
   ReSerVation Protocol [RFC2205] (RSVP) and RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and
   [RFC3473].

   A critical DetNet service enabled by QoS (and perhaps CoS) is
   delivering zero congestion loss.  There are different mechanisms that
   maybe used separately or in combination to deliver a zero congestion
   loss service.  The key aspect of this objective is that DetNet
   packets are not discarded due to congestion at any point in a DetNet
   aware network.

   In the context of the data plane solution there should be means for
   flow identification, which then can be used to map a flow against
   specific resources and treatment in a node enforcing the QoS.
   Hereto, certain aspects of CoS and QoS may be provided by the
   underlying sub-net technology, e.g., actual queuing or IEEE 802.3x
   priority flow control (PFC).

3.10.  #9 Packet traceability

   For the network management and specifically for tracing
   implementation or network configuration errors any means to find out
   whether a packet is a replica, which node performed replication, and
   which path was intended for the replica, can be very useful.  This
   criteria concerns the availability of solutions for tracing packets
   in the context of data plane protocol alternative.  Packet trace is a
   form of OAM.

3.11.  #10 Technical maturity

   The technical maturity of the data plane solution alternative is
   crucial, since it basically defines the effort, time line and risks
   involved for the use of the solution in deployments.  For example,
   the maturity level can be categorised as available immediately,
   available with small extensions, available with repurposing/
   redefining portions of the protocol or its header fields.  Yet
   another important measure for maturity is the deployment experience.
   This criteria concerns the maturity of the data plane protocol
   alternative as the solution alternative.  This criteria is
   particularly important given, as previously noted, that the DetNet
   data plane solution is expected to impact, i.e., be supported in,
   hardware.

4.  Data plane solution alternatives

   The following sections describe and rate deterministic data plane
   solution alternatives.  In "Analysis and Discussion" section each
   alternative is evaluated against the criteria given in Section 3 and
   rated using the following: (M)eets the criteria, (W)ork needed, and
   (N)ot suitable or too much work envisioned.

4.1.  Net layer technologies

4.1.1.  Native IPv6 transport

4.1.1.1.  Solution description

   This section investigates the application of native IPv6 [RFC2460] as
   the data plane for deterministic networking along the criteria
   collected in Section 3.

   The application of higher OSI layer headers, i.e., headers deeper in
   the packet, can be considered.  Two aspects have to be taken into
   account for such solutions. (i) Those header fields can be encrypted.
   (ii) Those header fields are deeper in the packet, therefore, routers
   have to apply deep packet inspection.  See further details in
   Section 5.6.

4.1.1.2.  Analysis and Discussion

   Encapsulation and overhead (W)

      Deterministic flows are assumed to be handled natively at layer-3
      by IPv6 at the first place.  The fixed header of an IPv6 packet is
      40 bytes [RFC2460].  This overhead is bigger if any Extension
      Header is used, and a generic behaviour for host and forwarding



Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 17, 2016              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


      nodes is specified in [RFC7045].  However, the exact overhead
      (Section 3.2) depends on what solution is actually used to provide
      DetNet features, e.g., explicit routing or seamless redundancy if
      any of these is applied.

      IPv6 has two types of Extension Headers that are processed by
      intermediate routers between the source and the final destination
      and may be of interest for the data plane signaling, the Routing
      Header that is used to direct the traffic via intermediate routers
      in a strict or loose source routing way, and the Hop-by-Hop
      Options Header that carries optional information that must be
      examined by every node along a packet's delivery path.  The Hop-
      by-Hop Options Header, when present, must immediately follow the
      IPv6 Header and it is not possible to limit its processing to the
      end points of Source Routed segments.

      IPv6 also provides a Destination Options Header that is used to
      carry optional information to be examined only by a packet's
      destination node(s).  The encoding of the options used in the Hop-
      by-Hop and in the Destination Options Header indicates the
      expected behavior when a processing IPv6 node does not recognize
      the Option Type, e.g. skip or drop; it should be noted that due to
      performance restrictions nodes may ignore the Hop-by-Hop Option
      Header, drop packets containing a Hop-by-Hop Option Header, or
      assign packets containing a Hop-by-Hop Option Header to a slow
      processing path [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc2460bis] (e.g. punt packets from
      hardware to software forwarding which is highly detrimental to the
      performance).

      The creation of new Extension Headers that would need to be
      processed by intermediate nodes is strongly discouraged.  In
      particular, new Extension Header(s) having hop-by-hop behavior
      must not be created or specified.  New options for the existing
      Hop-by-Hop Header should not be created or specified unless no
      alternative solution is feasible [RFC6564].


   Stream identification (M/W)

      The 20-bit flow label field of the fixed IPv6 header is suitable
      to distinguish different deterministic flows.  But guidance on the
      use of the flow label provided by [RFC6437] places restrictions on
      how the flow label can be used.  In particular, labels should be
      chosen from an approximation to a discrete uniform distribution.
      Additionally, existing implementations generally do not open APIs
      to control the flow label from the upper layers.





Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 17, 2016              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


      Alternatively, the Stream identification could be transported in a
      new option in the Hop-by-Hop Options Header.

   Explicit routes (W)

      The general assumption is that a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
      [RFC7426] based approach is applied to compute, establish and
      manage the explicit routes, leveraging Traffic Engineering (TE)
      extensions to routing protocols [RFC5305]
      [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-distribution] and evolutions to the Path
      Computation Element (PCE) Architecture [RFC5440], though a number
      of issues remain to be solved [RFC7399].

      Segment Routing (SR) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] is a new
      initiative to equip IPv6 with explicit routing capabilities.  The
      idea for the DetNet data plane would be to apply SR to IPv6 with
      the addition of a new type of routing extension header
      [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] to explicitly signal the
      path in the data plane between the source and the destination,
      and/or between replication points and elimination points if this
      functionality is used.

      Another concern regarding packet replication is how to enforce
      replicated packets to take different route while the final
      destination still remains the same.  With strict source routing,
      all the intermediate hops are listed and paths can be guaranteed
      to be non-overlapping.  Loose source routing only signals some of
      the intermediate hops and it takes additional knowledge to ensure
      that there is no single point of failure.


   Packet replication (W)

      [Editor's note: at the DetNet Transport layer this criteria does
      not concern packet deletion, only the packet replication.  The
      packet deletion belongs to the DetNet Service layer]

      The functionality of replicating a packet exists in IPv6 but is
      limited to multicast flows.  On the other hand, there is currently
      no specification for the duplicate packet deletion functionality
      at the elimination points.  The behaviour of keeping a state about
      received packets exists in Neighbor Discovery during the address
      resolution process, but it is limited to final delivery and prone
      to DOS attacks.

      As discussed above, IP-in-IP encapsulation and Segment Routing
      could be leveraged to signal a segment in a packet.  A replication
      point would insert a different routing header in each copy it



Korhonen, et al.       Expires September 17, 2016              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


      makes, the routing header providing explicitly the hops to the
      elimination point for that particular replica of the packet, in a
      strict or in a loose source routing fashion.  An elimination point
      would pop the routing headers from the various copies it gets and
      forward or receive the packet if it is the final destination.


   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (M/W)

      IPv6 enjoys the existing toolbox for generic IP network
      management.  However, IPv6 specific management features are still
      not at the level of that IPv4 has.  This specifically concerns the
      areas that are IPv6 specific, for example, related to neighbor
      discovery protocol (ND), stateless address autoconfiguration
      (SLAAC), subscriber identification, and security.  While the
      standards are already mostly in place the implementations in
      deployed equipment can be lacking or inadequate for commercial
      deployments.  This is largely only an issue with old existing
      equipment.

   Class and quality of service capabilities (M)

      The traffic class field of the fixed IPv6 header is designed for
      this purpose.

   Packet traceability (M/W/N)

      The traceability of replicated packets involves the capability to
      resolve which replication point issued a particular copy of a
      packet, which segment was intended for that replica, and which
      particular packet of which particular flow this is. sequence also
      depends on the sequencing mechanism.  The replication point may be
      indicated as the source of the packet if IP-in-IP encapsulation is
      used to forward along segments.  An alternate to IP-in-IP
      tunneling along segments would be to protect the original source
      address in a destination option similar to the Home Address option
      [RFC6275] and then use the address of the replication point as
      source in the IP header.

      The traceability also involves the capability to determine if a
      particular segment is operational.  While IPv6 as such has no
      support for reversing a path this, it appears source route
      extensions such as the one defined for segment routing could be
      used for tracing purposes.  Though it is not a usual practice,
      IPv6 [RFC2460] expects that a Source Route path may be reversed,
      and the standard insists that a node must not include the reverse
      of a Routing Header in the response unless the received Routing
      Header was authenticated.

   Technical maturity (M/W)

      IPv6 has been around about 20 years.  However, large scale global
      and commercial IPv6 deployments are rather new dating only few
      years back to around 2012.  While IPv6 has proven itself there are
      number of small issues to work on as they show up once operations
      experience grows.

      The Cisco 6Lab site [sixlab] provides information on IPv6
      deployment per country, indicating figures for prefixes, transit
      AS, content and users.  Per this site, many countries, including
      Canada, Brazil, the USA, Germany, France, Japan, Portugal, Sweden,
      Finland, Norway, Greece, and Ecuador, achieve a deployment ratio
      above 30 percent, and the overall adoption reported by Google
      Statistics [googleipv6] is now above 10 percent.


4.1.2.  Summary

   TBD.

4.2.  Native IPv4 transport

4.2.1.  Solution description

   [Editor's note: this section has not been cleaned yet for the new
   division of criteria.]

   IPv4 [RFC0791] is in principle the same as IPv6, except that it has a
   smaller address space.  However, IPv6 was designed around the fact
   that extension headers are an integral part of the protocol and
   operation from the beginning, although the practise may some times
   prove differently [I-D.ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world].  IPv4
   never really needed any extension headers to work properly, thus
   support for IPv4 options outside closed networks cannot typically be
   guaranteed.  In the context of deterministic networking data plane
   solutions the major difference between IPv4 and IPv6 seems to be the
   practical support for header extensibility.  Anything below and above
   the IP header independent of the verion is practically the same.

4.2.2.  Analysis and Discussion

   Encapsulation and overhead (M)

      The fixed header of an IPv4 packet is 20 bytes [RFC0791].  IP
      options add overhead and the maximum IPv4 header size if 60 octets
      leaving only 40 octets for possible options.

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


   Stream identification (W/N)

      The IPv4 header has a 16-bit identification field that was
      originally intended for assisting fragmentation and reassembly of
      IPv4 packets as described in [RFC0791].  The identification field
      has also been proposed to be used for actually identifying flows
      between two IP addresses and a given protocol for detecting and
      removing duplicate packets [RFC1122].  However, recent update
      [RFC6864] to both [RFC0791] and [RFC1122] restricts the use of
      IPv4 identification field only to fragmentation purposes.

      The IPv4 also has a stream identifier option [RFC0791], which
      contains a 16-bit SATNET stream identifier.  However, the option
      has been deprecated [RFC6814].  The conclusion is that stream
      identification does not work nicely with IPv4 header alone and a
      traditional 5-tuple identification might not also be enough in a
      case of a flow duplication.  For a working solution upper layer
      protocol headers such as the RTP are required for unambiguous flow
      identification.

   Explicit routes (M/W)

      IPv4 has two source routing option specified: the loose source and
      record route option (LSRR), and the strict source and record route
      option (SSRR) [RFC0791].  The support of these options in the
      Internet is questionable but within a closed network the support
      may be assumed.

   Packet replication (W/N)

      The functionality of replicating a packet exists in IPv4 but is
      limited to multicast flows.  In general the issue regarding the
      IPv6 packet replication also applies to IPv4.  Duplicate packet
      detection for IPv4 is studied in [RFC6621] to a great detail in
      the context of simplified multicast forwarding.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (M)

      IPv4 enjoys the extensive and "complete" existing toolbox for
      generic IP network management.

   Class and quality of service capabilities (M)

      The type of service (TOS) field of the fixed IPv4 header is
      designed for this purpose.

   Packet traceability (W/N)

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


      The IPv4 has a traceroute option [RFC1393] that could be used to
      record the route the packet took.  However, the option has been
      deprecated [RFC6814].  Similarly to IPv6 new work would be needed
      to allow better traceability of IPv4 packets.

   Technical maturity (M/W)

      IPv4 can be considered mature technology with over 30 years of
      implementation, deployment and operations experience.  However, no
      new IPv4 standards development is "allowed" anymore
      [RFC6540][I-D.ietf-sunset4-gapanalysis].


4.2.3.  Summary

4.3.  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

4.3.1.  Solution description

   Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS) [RFC3031] and its
   variants, MPLS with Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) [RFC3209] and
   [RFC3473], and MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) [RFC5921] is a widely
   deployed technology that switches traffic based on MPLS label stacks
   [RFC3032] and [RFC5960].  MPLS is the foundation for Pseudowire-based
   services 5.4 and emerging technologies such as Bit-Indexed Explicit
   Replication (BIER) 5.5.1 and Segment Routing
   [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spring/charter/].

   The remainder of this section is a work in progress and draws heavily
   from [RFC5921].

   MPLS supports both the DetNet Service and DetNet Transport layers and
   provides a very rich set of mechanisms that can be reused directly,
   and perhaps augmented in certain cases, to deliver DetNet services.
   At the DetNet Transport layer, MPLS provides forwarding, protection
   and OAM services.  At the DetNet Service Layer it provides client
   service adaption, directly, via Pseudowires and other label-like
   mechanisms (e.g., EPVN control word [EVPN]).  Are representation of
   these options are shown in Figure 3.

   In the contex of deterministic networking the MPLS as such is
   specifically on the "Net" layer.  Some additional functionality or a
   shim layer on a top of the MPLS trasnport is most likely needed on
   the "Det" layer to enable a complete deterministic networking data
   plane solution.

5.1.2.  Analysis and Discussion

   Encapsulation and overhead (M)

      GRE provides encapsulation for a network layer protocol over
      anther network layer protocol.  A new protocol type for Detnet
      traffics should be allocated as an "Ether Type" in [RFC1700] and
      in [ETYPES].  The fixed header of a GRE packet is 4 octets while
      the maximum header is 16 octets with optional fields in Figure 5.

   Stream identification (W)

      There is no flow identification field in GRE header.  However, it
      can rely on the flow identification mechanism applied in the

      delivery protocols, such as flow identification stated in IP
      section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 when the delivery protocol are IPv6 and
      IPv4 respectively.  Alternatively, the Key field can also be
      extended to carry the flow identification.  The size of Key field
      is 4 octets.

   Packet sequencing (M)

      As stated in section 3.x.1, GRE provides an optional sequencing
      number in its header to provide sequencing services for packets.
      The size of the sequencing number is 32 bits.

   Duplicate packet deletion (N)

      GRE has no packet replication and deletion currently in its header
      and should be extended or rely on delivery protocols.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (W/N)

      [note: rely on the delivery protocol] GRE has no packet
      replication and deletion currently and should be relied on
      delivery protocols.

   Time synchronization (W/N)

      [note: rely on the delivery protocol] GRE has no packet
      replication and deletion currently and should be relied on
      delivery protocols.

   Class and quality of service capabilities (W/N)

      [note: rely on the delivery protocol] GRE has no packet
      replication and deletion currently and should be relied on
      delivery protocols.  For the class of service capability, an
      optional code point field to indicate CoS of a traffic can be
      extended in GRE header.

   Technical maturity (M)

      GRE has been developed over 20 years.  The delivery protocol
      mostly used is IPv4, while the IPv6 support for GRE is to be
      standardized now in IETF as [I-D.ietf-intarea-gre-ipv6].  Due to
      its good extensibility, GRE is also extended to support network
      virtualization in Data Center, which is NVGRE [RFC7637].

   and behaviour of a telecommunications service over a packet switched
   network (PSN) using IP or MPLS transport.  In addition to traditional
   telecommunications services such as T1 line or Frame Relay, PWs also
   provide transport for Ethernet service [RFC4448] and for generic

               Figure 6: PWE3 protocol stack reference model

   PWs appear as a good data plane solution alternative for a number of
   reasons.  PWs are a proven and deployed technology with a rich OAM
   control plane [RFC4447], and enjoy the toolbox developed for MPLS
   networks.  Furthermore, PWs may have an optional Control Word (CW) as
   part of the payload encapsulation between the PSN and the emulated
   service that is, for example, capable of frame sequencing and
   duplicate detection.  The encapsulation layer may also provide timing
   [RFC5087].

   PWs can be also used if the PSN is IP, which enables the application
   of PWs in networks that do not have MPLS enabled in their core
   routers.  One approach to provide PWs over IP is to provide MPLS over
   IP in some way and then leverage what is available for PWs over MPLS.
   The following standard solutions are available both for IPv4 and IPv6
   to follow this approach.  The different solutions have different
   overhead as discussed in the following subsection.  The MPLS-in-IP
   encapsulation is specified by [RFC4023].  The IPv4 Protocol Number
   field or the IPv6 Next Header field is set to 137, which indicates an
   MPLS unicast packet.  (The use of the MPLS-in-IP encapsulation for
   MPLS multicast packets is not supported.)  The MPLS-in-GRE
   encapsulation is specified in [RFC4023], where the IP header (either
   IPv4 or IPv6) is followed by a GRE header, which is followed by an
   MPLS label stack.  The protocol type field in the GRE header is set
   to MPLS Unicast (0x8847) or Multicast (0x8848).  MPLS over L2TPv3
   over IP encapsulation is specified by [RFC4817].  The MPLS-in-UDP
   encapsulation is specified by [RFC7510], where the UDP Destination
   Port indicates tunneled MPLS packet and the UDP Source Port is an

   entropy value that is generated by the encapsulator to uniquely
   identify a flow.  MPLS-in-UDP encapsulation can be applied to enable
   UDP-based ECMP (Equal-Cost Multipath) or Link Aggregation.  All these
   solutions can be secured with IPSec.

5.4.2.  Analysis and Discussion

   Encapsulation and overhead (M)

      PWs offer encapsulation services practically for any types of
      payloads over any PSN.  New PW types need a code point allocation
      [RFC4446] and in some cases an emulated service specific document.

      Specifically in the case of the MPLS PSN the PW encapsulation
      overhead is minimal.  Typically minimum two labels and a CW is
      needed, which totals to 12 octets.  PW type specific handling
      might, however, allow optimizations on the emulated service in the
      provider edge (PE) device's native service processing (NSP) /
      forwarder function.  These optimizations could be used, for
      example, to reduce header overhead.  Ethernet PWs already have
      rather low overhead [RFC4448].  Without a CW and VLAN tags the
      Ethernet header gets reduced to 14 octets (minimum Ethernet header
      overhead is 26).

      The overhead is somewhat bigger in case of IP PSN if an MPLS over
      IP solution is applied to provide PWs.  IP adds at least 20 (IPv4)
      or 40 (IPv6) bytes overhead to the PW over MPLS overhead;
      furthermore, the GRE, L2TPv3, or UDP header has to be taken into
      account if any of these further encapsulations is used.

   Stream identification (M)

      PWs provide multiple layers of flow identification, especially in
      the case of the MPLS PSN.  The PWs are typically prepended with a
      PW label that can be used to identify a specific PW.  Furthermore,
      the PSN also uses one or more labels to transport packets over a
      specific label switched paths (that then would carry PWs).  IP
      (and other) PSNs would need other mechanisms, such as, UDP port
      numbers, upper layer protocol header (like TRP) or some IP
      extension header to provide required flow identification.

   Packet sequencing (M)

      As mentioned earlier PWs may contain an optional CW that is able
      to provide sequencing services.  The size of the sequence number
      in the generic CW is 16 bits, which might be, depending on the
      used link speed be too little.

Internet-Draft       DetNet data plane alternatives           March 2016


   Duplicate packet deletion (W)

      The PW duplicate detection mechanism also exists in theory
      [RFC3985] but no emulated service makes use of it currently.

   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (M/W)

      PWs have rich control plane for OAM and in a case of the MPLS PSN
      enjoy the full control plane toolbox developed for MPLS network
      OAM likewise IP PSN have the full toolbox of IP network OAM tools.
      There could be, however, need for deterministic networking
      specific extensions for the mentioned control planes.

   Time synchronization (M)

      It is possible to carry time synchronization information as part
      of the PW encapsulation layer (see for example [RFC5087]).
      Whether the timing precision is enough for all deterministic
      networking use cases vary, and it is possible existing mechanisms
      are not adequate for all use cases.  IP PSNs have already
      demonstarted the use of time synchronization as a part of PWE3
      [RFC5086].

   Class and quality of service capabilities (M)

      In a case of IP PSN the 6-bit differentiated services code point
      (DSCP) field can be used for indicating the class of service
      [RFC2474] and 2-bit field reserved for the explicit congestion
      notification (ECN) [RFC3168].  Similarly, in a case of MPLS PSN,
      there are 3-bit traffic class field (TC) [RFC5462] in the label
      reserved for for both Explicitly TC-encoded-PSC LSPs (E-LSP)
      [RFC3270] and ECN [RFC5129].  Due to the limited number of bits in
      the TC field, their use for QoS and ECN functions restricted and
      intended to be flexible.  Although the Qos/CoS mechanism is
      already in place some clarifications may be required in the
      context of deterministic networking flows, for example, if some
      specific mapping between bit fields have to be done.

   Technical maturity (M)

      PWs, IP and MPLS are proven technologies with wide variety of
      deployments and years of operational experience.  Furthermore, the
      estimated work for missing functionality (packet replication and
      deletion) does not appear to be extensive, since the existing
      protection mechanism already get close to what is needed from the
      deterministic networking data plane solution.

   PseudoWires appear to be a strong candidate as the deterministic
   networking data plane solution alternative.  The strong points are
   the technical maturity and the extensive control plane for OAM.  This

5.5.1.1.  Solution description

   The DetNet may be presented in BIER as distinctive payload type with
   its own Proto(col) ID.  Then it is likely that DetNet will have the
   header that would identify:

   o  Version;
   o  Sequence Number;
   o  Timestamp;
   o  Payload type, e.g. data vs. OAM.

   DetNet node, collocated with BFIR, may use multiple BIER sub-domains
   to create replicated flows.  Downstream DetNet nodes, collocated with
   BFER, would terminate redundant flows based on Sequence Number and/or
   Timestamp information.  Such DetNet may be BFER in one BIER sub-
   domain and BFIR in another.  Thus DetNet flow would traverse several
   BIER sub-domains.

5.5.1.2.  Analysis and Discussion

5.5.1.3.  Summary

5.5.2.  BIER - Traffic Engineering

   [LB: This really should be merged with previous section.]

   An alternate use of Bit-Indexed Explicit Replication (BIER) uses bits
   in the BitString to represent adjacencies as opposed to destinations,
   as discussed in BIER Traffic Engineering (TE)
   [I-D.eckert-bier-te-arch].

   The proposed function of BIER-TE in the DetNet data plane is to
   control the process of replication and elimination, as opposed to the
   identification of the flows or and the sequencing of packets within a
   flow.

   At the path ingress, BIER-TE identifies the adjacencies that are
   activated for this packet (under the rule of the controller).  At the
   egress, BIER-TE is used to identify the adjacencies where
   transmission failed.  This information is passed to the controller,
   which in turn can modify the active adjacencies for the next packets.

   The value is that the replication can be controlled and monitored
   with the granularity of a packet and a adjacency in a control loops
   that involves an external controller.

5.5.2.1.  Solution description

   BIER-TE enables to activate the replication and elimination functions
   in a manner that is abstract to the data plane forwarding
   information.  An adjacency, which is represented by a bit in the BIER
   header, can correspond in the data plane to an Ethernet hop, a Label
   Switched Path, or it can correspond to an IPv6 loose or strict source
   routed path.

   In a nutshell, BIER-TE is used as follows:

   o  A controller computes a complex path, sometimes called a track,
      which takes the general form of a ladder.  The steps and the side
      rails between them are the adjacencies that can be activated on
      demand on a per-packet basis using bits in the BIER header.

      Figure 9: Ladder Shape with Replication and Elimination Points

   o  The controller assigns a BIER domain, and inside that domain,
      assigns bits to the adjacencies.  The controller assigns each bit
      to a replication node that sends towards the adjacency, for
      instance the ingress router into a segment that will insert a
      routing header in the packet.  A single bit may be used for a step
      in the ladder, indicating the other end of the step in both
      directions.


                            ===> (A) ====> (C) ====

                         Figure 10: Assigning Bits

   o  The controller activates the replication by deciding the setting
      of the bits associated with the adjacencies.  This decision can be
      modified at any time, but takes the latency of a controller round
      trip to effectively take place.  Below is an example that uses
      Replication and Elimination to protect the A->C adjacency.

                     Table 1: Controlling Replication

   o  The BIER header with the controlling BitString is injected in the
      packet by the ingress node of the deterministic path.  That node
      may act as a replication point, in which case it may issue
      multiple copies of the packet

                      Figure 11: Enabled Adjacencies

   o  For each of its bits that is set in the BIER header, the owner
      replication point resets the bit and transmits towards the
      associated adjacency; to achieve this, the replication point
      copies the packet and inserts the relevant data plane information,
      such as a source route header, towards the adjacency that
      corresponds to the bit

   o  But if a transmission failed along the way, one (or more) bit is
      never cleared.  Table 4 provides the possible outcomes of a
      transmission.  If the frame is lost, then it is probably due to a
      failure in either I->A or C->E, and the controller should enable
      I->B and D->E to find out.  A BitString of 00010000 indicates
      unequivocally a transmission error on the A->C adjacency, and a
      BitString of 01001100 indicates a loss in either A->B, B->D or
      D->C; enabling D->E on the next packets may provide more
      information to sort things out.

   In more details:

   The BIER header is of variable size, and a DetNet network of a
   limited size can use a model with 64 bits if 64 adjacencies are
   enough, whereas a larger deployment may be able to signal up to 256
   adjacencies for use in very complex paths.

                         Figure 12: BIER-TE Header

   For the DetNet data plane, a replication point is an ingress point
   for more than one adjacency, and an elimination point is an egress
   point for more than one adjacency.

   A pre-populated state in a replication node indicates which bits are
   served by this node and to which adjacency each of these bits
   corresponds.  With DetNet, the state is typically installed by a
   controller entity such as a PCE.  The way the adjacency is signaled
   in the packet is fully abstracted in the bit representation and must
   be provisioned to the replication nodes and maintained as a local
   state, together with the timing or shaping information for the
   associated flow.

   The DetNet data plane uses BIER-TE to control which adjacencies are
   used for a given packet.  This is signaled from the path ingress,
   which sets the appropriate bits in the BIER BitString to indicate
   which replication must happen.

   The replication point clears the bit associated to the adjacency
   where the replica is placed, and the elimination points perform a
   logical AND of the BitStrings of the copies that it gets before
   forwarding.

   As is apparent in the examples above, clearing the bits enables to
   trace a packet to the replication points that made any particular
   copy.  BIER-TE also enables to detect the failing adjacencies or
   sequences of adjacencies along a path and to activate additional
   replications to counter balance the failures.

   Finally, using the same BIER-TE bit for both directions of the steps
   of the ladder enables to avoid replication in both directions along

   the crossing adjacencies.  At the time of sending along the step of
   the ladder, the bit may have been already reset by performing the AND
   operation with the copy from the other side, in which case the
   transmission is not needed and does not occur (since the control bit
   is now off).

5.6.  Higher layer header fields

   Fields of headers belonging to higher OSI layers, e.g., transport
   layer, can be used to implement functionality that is not provided
   e.g., by the IPv6 or IPv4 header fields.  However, this approach
   cannot be always applied, e.g., due to encryption.  Furthermore, even
   if this approach is applicable, it requires deep packet inspection
   from the routers and switches.  There are implementation dependent
   limits how far into the packet the lookup can be done efficiently in
   the fast path.  In general a safe bet is between 128 and 256 octets
   for the maximum lookup depth.  Various higher layer protocols can be
   applied.  Some examples are provided here for the sequence numbering
   feature (Section 3.4).

5.6.1.  TCP

   The TCP header includes a sequence number parameter, which can be
   applied to detect and eliminate duplicate packets if seamless
   redundancy is used.  As the TCP header is right after the IP header,
   it does not require very deep packet inspection; the 4-byte sequence
   number is conveyed by bits 32 through 63 of the TCP header.  In
   addition to sequencing, the TCP header also contain source and
   destination port information that can be used for assisting the flow
   identification.

5.6.2.  RTP

   RTP is often used to deliver time critical traffic in IP networks.
   RTP is is carried on top of IP and UDP [RFC3550].  The RTP header
   includes a 2-byte sequence number, which can be used to detect and
   eliminate duplicate packets if seamless redundancy is used.  The
   sequence number is conveyed by bits 16 through 31 of the RTP header.
   In addition to the sequence number the RTP header has also timestamp
   field (bits 32 through 63) that can be useful for time
   synchronization purposes.  Furthermore, the RTP header has also one
   or more synchronization sources (bits starting from 64) that can
   potentially be useful for flow identification purposes.
